# fashion-mnist

An assignment carried out as part of the Master 1 Software Engineering major at the University of Bordeaux.

## What is Fashion MNIST?

Created in 2017, [fashion-mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a freely available dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The dataset is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size and the structure of training and testing splits.
